#TurnBots

##Goal
Train units that can make strategic decisions on where to move depending on the
positions of nearby enemies and food.


##Description

###Environment
The environment is made up by squares (tiles) in a large grid. In each tile there
can be either an enemy or a piece of food. The boarder tiles will either kill the
unit if stepped on or just harm them.


###Movement and sight
Every unit can only see the surrounding 8 tiles and these (+its hunger and health)
are the inputs for the neural network (10 inputs in total). A unit can only move to
one of the 4 closest tiles (up, down, left, right) and this is the output of the
neural network. The decision of where to move is made by the units brain.


###Attacks
If a unit chooses to move to a squre occupied by an enemy the unit with the most
health will survive and the attacking unit will lose an amount of health depending
on how much health the opponent had [attack_damage].


###Food and health
Per turn each every unit looses some amount of hunger (100 hunger means full and 0
means starving). If the units hunger is less than [starvation_limit] the units will
lose [starvation_damage] amount of health that turn.

If [hunger] is [max_hunger] the unit will gain [health_increase] that turn. However,
